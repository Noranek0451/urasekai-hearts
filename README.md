# Installation
This texture pack requires <a href="https://github.com/Kekulism/DeckSkinsLite"> DeckSkinsLite</a> to implement the textures properly. Once you have DeckSkinsLite set up, extract the zip file and copy the contents to the mod folder (...\AppData\Roaming\Balatro\Mods\DeckSkinsLite). From there, you should be all good to go!
# Notes
I recommend playing with pixel smoothing on and high contrast off for best visibility.
